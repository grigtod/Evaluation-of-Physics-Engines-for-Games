# Evaluation-of-Physics-Engines-for-Games
Evaluates PhysX, Havok and Bullet engine. 


Info:
This is C++ based and uses some OOP.
I used OpenGL for rendering and Anttweakbar for the UI.

The goal of the project was to evaluate different physics engines. 
I implemented PhysX, Bullet and Havok in one application, 
which made it possible to compare them easily.
You can read about my findings here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bxc2hRv1Yzs-UC1uM3I2bDI1aGc/view

 
In order to keep the file size small (and for legal reasons as I can't redistribute PhysX and Havok libraries)
I have removed all the PhysX, Bullet and Havok libraries.

The "Development" folder consists of the source code.
The executable is in "Build\Release".

Controls:
LMB and Mouse Scroll.
